    /*
     * Problem: write a function that takes in an array of positive integers
     * representing the heights of adjacent buildings and returns the area of
     * the largest rectangle that can be created by any number of adjacent
     * building, including just one building. Note that all building have the
     * same width of 1 unit.
     *
     * For example, given buildings = [2, 1, 2], the area of the largest
     * rectangle that can be created is 3, using all three buildings. Since the
     * minimum height of the three buildings is 1, you can create a rectangle
     * that has a height of 1 and a width of 3 (the number of buildings). You
     * could also create rectangles of area 2 by using only the first building
     * or the last building, but these clearly wouldn't be the largest rectangles.
     * Similarly, you could create rectangles of area 2 by using the first and
     * second building or the second and third building.
     *
     * To clarify, the width of a created rectangle is the number of building used
     * to create the rectangle, and its height is the height of the smallest
     * building used to create it.
     *
     * Note that if no rectangles can be created, your function should return 0.
