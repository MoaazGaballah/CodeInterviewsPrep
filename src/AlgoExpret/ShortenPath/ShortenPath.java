     * Problem: Write a function that in a non-empty string represinting a valid
     * unix-shell path and returns a shortened version of that path.
     * 
     * A path is a notation that represents the location of a file or directory in
     * a file system.
     * 
     * In a Unix-like operating system, a path is bound by the following rules:
     * - The root directory is represented by a /. This means that if a path starts
     *   /, it's an absolute path; if it doesn't, it's a relative path.
     * - The symbol / otherwise represents the directory seperator. This means that
     *   the path /foo/bar is the location of the directory bar inside the directory
     *   foo, which is itself located inside the root directory.
     * - The symbol .. represents the parent directory. This means that accessing
     *   files or directories in /foo/bar/.. is equivalent to accessing files or 
     *   directories in /foo.
     * - The symbol . represents the current directory. This means that accessing 
     *   file or directories in /foo/bar/. is equivalent to accessing files or
     *   directories in /foo/bar.
     * - The symbols / and . can be repeated sequentially without consequence; the
     *   symbol .. cannot, however, because repeating it sequentially means going 
     *   further up in parent directories. For example, /foo/bar/baz/././. and
     *   /foo/bar/baz are equivalent paths, but /foo/bar/baz/../../../ and
     *   /foo/bar/baz difinitely aren't. The only exception is with the root
     *   directory: /../../.. and / are equivalent, because the root directory has
     *   no parent directory, which means that repeatedly accessing parent directory
     *   does nothing.
     * 
     * Note that the shortened version of the path must be equivalent to the original
     * path. In other words, it must point to the same file or directory as the 
     * original path.
