     * ()[]{} and other optional chatacters. The function should return
     * a boolean representing whether the string is balanced with regards
     * to brackets.
     * A String is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets
     * of a certain type as it has closing bracket of that type and if no
     * bracket is unmatched, Note that and opening bracket can't match 
     * a corresponding closing bracket that comes before it, and similarly,
     * a closing bracket can't match a corresponding opning bracket that
     * comes after it. Also, brackets can't overlap each other as in [(])
